 * The source of truth used for credential presentment.
 *
 * This is used whenever an application wishes to present credentials including the [DocumentStore]
 * which holds credentials that can be presented and a [DocumentTypeRepository] which contains descriptions
 * of well-known document types which may be shown in a consent prompt.
 *
 * It's also used for more dynamic data such as determining whether the requester is trusted (via [resolveTrust])
 * and if so what branding to show, whether user consent should be obtained or if preconsent exists (via
 * [showConsentPrompt]), and even what kind of user authentication to perform to present the credential, if any (by
 * picking a [Credential] from an appropriate domain in [selectCredential]).
 *
 * @property documentStore the [DocumentStore] which holds credentials that can be presented.
 * @property documentTypeRepository a [DocumentTypeRepository] which holds metadata for document types.
 * @property zkSystemRepository a [ZkSystemRepository] with ZKP systems or `null`.
 * @see SimplePresentmentSource for one concrete implementation tailored for ISO mdoc and IETF SD-JWT VC credentials.
